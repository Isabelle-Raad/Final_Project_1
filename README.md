# Module 21 Challenge: 

## Artist vs Artwork Overview
We chose this topic because art is global and there's tons of data/datasets available to test different scenarios and theories. 

### Data Source
https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/tree/master

### Technologies Used
   - PostgreSQL
   - Quick DBD
   - Juypter Notebook
   - GitBash
   - GitHub
   - Python
   - Tableau
## Questions to Answer:
1. What conditions do most artists come from? Time, nationality, region
   - Nationality: Matplotlib stuff, pie charts (Team effort)
   - Artists with lat, long use unit 6 code to map... shows hotspots of art (Ester)
   - Time: time series analyses (Inina)
2. What timeframe experienced most increased value of art? 
   - Use algorithm to adjust for inflation (bar chart matplotlib)... most work comes from inflation-adjustment algorithm and finding current and past art values (Raad)
    
## Deliverable 1:   
    
### Quick DBD
We started our project by using Quick DBD to create a diagram of database.

### PostgreSQL
We then used the diagram as a guide to create our database in PostgreSQL

![Artists Table](https://github.com/Locdintech/UFOs/assets/116410666/acecdea5-8609-47f3-9e0d-dbc4c2ff96f4)

![Artworks Table](https://github.com/Locdintech/UFOs/assets/116410666/a01e93e9-db0e-4130-9501-5fd914614d90)

## Deliverable 2:   
Working on Tableau to create a hotspot map
Having issues with the artworks data, Isabelle's working through cleaning it again

### PostgreSQL
I loaded the csv data into the Artist table in PostgreSQL

### Tableau Analysis 
For this visualization, I started by counting the number of Artists.

Then I looked at the gender by percentage. We can see that there are more male artists than female.

Then I wanted to create a map that shows the location of all the artistsâ€™ nationalities. Since I did not have the longitude nor the latitude in my dataset, I had to create my own. To do this, I clicked on Nationality in the dataset, clicked on geographic role then country/region.

Here is the number of Artists by nationality. We can clearly see that there are more American Artists followed by French and Germans.

Here is the type of art. The dominant type of art is Drawings and Prints, then Photography and finally Architecture and design.
