# Module 21 Challenge: 

## Artist vs Artwork Overview
We chose this topic because art is global and there's tons of data/datasets available to test different scenarios and theories. 

### Data Source
https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/tree/master

### Technologies Used
   - PostgreSQL
   - Quick DBD
   - Juypter Notebook
   - GitBash
   - GitHub
   - Python
   - Tableau
## Questions to Answer:
1. What conditions do most artists come from? Time, nationality, region
   - Nationality: Matplotlib stuff, pie charts (Team effort)
   - Artists with lat, long use unit 6 code to map... shows hotspots of art (Ester)
   - Time: time series analyses (Inina)
2. What timeframe experienced most increased value of art? 
   - Use algorithm to adjust for inflation (bar chart matplotlib)... most work comes from inflation-adjustment algorithm and finding current and past art values (Raad)

### Quick DBD
We started our project by using Quick DBD to create a diagram of database.

### PostgreSQL
We then used the diagram as a guide to create our database in Postgre SQL
