# Module 21 Challenge: 

## Artist vs Artwork Overview
We chose this topic because art is global and there's tons of data/datasets available to test different scenarios and theories. 

### Data Source
https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/tree/master

### Technologies Used
   - PostgreSQL
   - Quick DBD
   - Juypter Notebook
   - GitBash
   - GitHub
   - Python
   - Tableau
## Questions to Answer:
1. What conditions do most artists come from? Time, nationality, region
   - Tableau stats visualizations - Ester

2. What countries can expect an increase of percentage of female artists?
   - Linear regression - Raad
   
3. Predict the liklihood of a piece of artwork being cataloged.
   - Supervised ML - Inina

### Quick DBD
We started our project by using Quick DBD to create a diagram of database.

### PostgreSQL
We then used the diagram as a guide to create our database in PostgreSQL

## Deliverable 2:   
Working on Tableau to create a hotspot map

### PostgreSQL
I loaded the csv data into the Artist table in PostgreSQL

### Tableau Analysis 
For this visualization, I started by counting the number of Artists.

Then I looked at the gender by percentage. We can see that there are more male artists than female.

Then I wanted to create a map that shows the location of all the artistsâ€™ nationalities. Since I did not have the longitude nor the latitude in my dataset, I had to create my own. To do this, I clicked on Nationality in the dataset, clicked on geographic role then country/region.

Here is the number of Artists by nationality. We can clearly see that there are more American Artists followed by French and Germans.

Here is the type of art. The dominant type of art is Drawings and Prints, then Photography and finally Architecture and design.
